# distance_vector_router
Distance Vector Routers Simulation

This project uses Bellman-Ford Algorithm to update routing tables for neighbouring Routers. This is completely implemented in Python. 

Models.py has the models required for Routing Table, Distance Vector and for Routers.

USAGE: ./python router.py [router_name]
